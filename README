YaGOL: Yet another Game Of Life ...

YaGOL is a Game Of Life clone using libSDL. I made this as an exercise
for one of my courses at University.

It makes use of libSDL, libSDL-ttf, libSDL-image. 
Having the required libraries and headers, it should be sufficient
to run "make" in the base directory to get a working executable in the
bin directory.

The interface is self-explanatory, but some of the buttons only work when
in pause mode (and you can't draw unless the simulation is paused).

Enjoy!
